# Project 8: Contacts

Teacher: David Steedman

This repository contains Project 8 for the MHS Software Engineering class, focusing on developing a Contacts program.

## Introduction
Project 8 involves completing a Contacts Program in Python, which manages a list of contacts with names and phone numbers.

## Main Project: Contacts Program
- File: [`contacts.py`](contacts.py)
- Description: The Contacts application developed in Python allows users to manage a contact list. Users can add, update, delete, search for, and view all contacts using a procedural approach.

## Requirements and Specifications

### Data Structure
- **Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to store contacts, where the key is the contact's name and the value is their phone number.

### Functions
The program should contain the functions below. 'View' and 'add' are already implemented. You will need to implement the 'delete', 'search' and 'update' functions yourself.
- `add_contact`: Adds a new contact to the dictionary.
- `update_contact`: Updates the phone number of an existing contact.
- `delete_contact`: Deletes a contact from the dictionary.
- `search_contact`: Searches for a contact and prints their details.
- `view_contacts`: Lists all contacts in the dictionary.


### Validation
The program should handle scenarios such as adding a contact that already exists, deleting a contact that doesn't exist, and searching for a contact that isn't in the list.

### Procedural Programming Paradigm
This project exemplifies procedural programming which is centered around the concepts of procedure calls, modularity, sequential execution, and shared state management. The contacts program is composed of distinct functions, each designed to carry out specific tasks, and represents a typical use case for procedural programming.

## Discussion Points
After opening the contacts program, consider how it demonstrates:
- Procedure Calls
- Modularity
- Sequential Execution
- Shared State Management

## Learning Outcomes
- Reinforce understanding of Python data structures, particularly dictionaries.
- Deepen comprehension of functions and procedural programming concepts.
- Apply logical thinking and problem-solving skills in a practical programming task.
- Prepare for the transition to object-oriented programming in future lessons.
